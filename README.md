##  Key SQL Concepts Applied

###  1. Basic Queries
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY` for filtering and sorting data

###  2. Aggregations
- Using `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()` to summarize data
- Grouping data with `GROUP BY`

###  3. Joins
- `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN` to merge data from related tables

###  4. Subqueries
- Nesting queries for complex filters and calculations

###  5. Views
- Creating reusable named queries for reporting and dashboards

###  6. Indexing
- Implementing indexes to optimize performance on large queries

##  Sample Query Snippets

```sql
-- Total revenue per product category
SELECT c.category_name, SUM(o.total_amount) AS revenue
FROM orders o
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.category_id
GROUP BY c.category_name
ORDER BY revenue DESC;
